Hello! My name is Giorgio Latour and I'm currently self studying to switch careers from physics research to data 
science or machine learning engineering.

One of the books I am studying is Aurélion Géron's *Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow*. 
Since this is a coding textbook, I decided to take notes using Jupyter Notebooks. In this repository you'll find my notes
on each chapter as well as a few of my answers to a select number of the chapter exercises.
