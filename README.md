Hello! My name is Giorgio Latour and I'm currently self studying to switch careers from physics research to data 
science or machine learning engineering.

One of the books I am studying is Aurélion Géron's *Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow*. 
Since this is a coding textbook, I decided to take notes using Jupyter Notebooks. 

In this repository you'll find my notes on each chapter as well as a few of my answers to a select number of the chapter exercises. I make no claim to any of Aurélion Géron's work. Since these are notes on his textbook, you'll find that a lot of what's written is similar to or verbatim to Géron's words. I am simply providing this repository as evidence that I've read through his book and done some of the exercises, and hope someone could find the notes and my self-explanations of particular topics useful.

Géron's book is incredibly well-written and a great starting point for anyone trying to learning about machine learning. I highly encourage you to purchase a copy of the book if you find my notes intriguing.
